# SwiftUIforAndroid
make android app with swiftui

The reason why I create this repository is that I hope in the future we could use SwiftUI write Android APP.

For now, jetpack compose is very similar with SwiftUI, and it also supports for ios.

So, I hope some day I could use SwiftUI write Android, while not use Kotlin write IOS.
